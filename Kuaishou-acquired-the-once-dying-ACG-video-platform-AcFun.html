<p><a href="./tag-Kuaishou.html">Kuaishou</a> has completed the acquisition of AcFun,According to Chinese tech media 36kr today.After going around many business talks with potential buyers,AcFun,a once-popular Chinese video platform,has finally grasped the chance to survive the fierce competition of its strong rivals of Chinese video sites.</p>
<p>Details of the specific transactions remains unknown.36kr received the information from multiple sources.When the tech media asked Kuaishou about the deal,it got the confirmations of the acquisition from the company.It is estimated that the price of Kuaishou's acquisition would be more than 750 million yuan(around 117 million dollars).In fact,rumors spread that Kuaishou had been considering a lead investment in AcFun.But the investment had to be canceled when Kuaishou had tried to find other investors interested in AcFun but received no intentions.</p>
<p>After the acquisition news was released,Kuaishou team posted a picture of two animation characters on Weibo and AcFun's Weibo account quickly retweeted the post,which also shows that the acquisition is done.</p>

<p>After the acquisition,it is said that AcFun will still be independent and Kuaishou will offer the once-dying animation platform startup resources,technical support and most importantly,MONEY.</p>
<p>It's not been easy for AcFun these years.In fact,AcFun is the first video sites that focus on ACG contents.ACG is short for animation,comics,and games.These days,Chinese girls and boys tend to accept and be interested Japanese culture and as a result,Japanese animation,comics,and games have been introduced to China and influencing many Chinese people,especially teenagers.AcFun was founded in 2007 and was originally a personal website.The name AcFun means "Anime Comic Fun" and the site was designed to share comics.In March 2018,AcFun copied the Japanese animation and video sharing website niconico and added some core features,which helped the site to develop its own unique culture.In around 2010,Wei Jun,the founder of AcFun,sold his website to Chen shaojie for 4 million yuan.</p>
<p>AcFun grew steadily and attracted more and more Chinese users who love ACG,although there had been several incidents in terms of the management of company.</p>
<p>AcFun brought in several rounds of ventures,which led to a complex ownership structure.The investors include China's internet giant Alibaba,Japanese company Softbank,and Cai dongqing,the boss of Chinese animation company aofei entertainment.AcFun's business model is simple,ads.The company tried various ways to gain profit,most of which failed.According to a financial report released by one of its main investors,AcFun‘s revenue was 3.63 million yuan in 2015 while the loss was 113 million yuan.In 2016,there was a sharp decline in revenue and the number is only around 71 thousand,with the loss was 146 million yuan.AcFun could not generate enough revenue to keep the company running and this problem was hard to fix.</p>
<p>Since November 2017,AcFun experienced a finance crisis for it had been unable to raise more money.In November and December 2017,it was reported that employees of the company had not been paid.Early in February 2018,users found that the website of AcFun was down.AcFun's platform was served on the Alibaba Cloud and the company was said to run out of money and could not afford the server fees.</p>

<p>In the morning of that day,AcFun's Weibo account posted "I want to live another 500 years" with a crying emoji.The words originally came from a song of popular Chinese tv drama on Kangxi Emperor.</p>
<p><img src="https://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/599a36b6ly1fo1x94vjl0j20go03vmxf.jpg" style="width: 450px;"></p>
<p>According to Chinese news media Caijing,Alibaba and Yunfeng Capital,a private equity company controlled by Alibaba’s founder,Jack Ma,reached to AcFun in 2018 and had several talks with it.Alibaba would like to take control of a ACG video platform and use it to defend Bilibili,backed by Alibaba's challenger,Tencent.But the deal failed to close.It's reported that Toutiao,also got interested in AcFun and had made several contacts with it.</p>
<p>When AcFun was in trouble,<a href="./tag-Bilibili.html">Bilibili</a>,another ACG platform went public on 28,March,2018 in the US.It is interesting to know that the founder of Bilibili was once a AcFun user who had been fed up with ACG and managed to create a new animation and video platform.Bilibili has grown fast and now is the lead in terms of China's ACG market share.AcFun's presence in China is dwarfed by that of Bilibili,which is now worth more than 4 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Kuaishou's acquisition of AcFun is a good news to everyone who has been a user since its start.Will AcFun come back to life and beat Bilibili?That's hard to say.But whatever the result is,Tencent will always be the winner as Tencent is one of the main investors of Kuaishou and Bilibili.</p></p></div>
