Note that xiaohongshu brought in 100 million dollars fund-raising 2 years ago.It was led by Tencent,Alibaba's biggest competitor in China.This time,the fund was led by Alibaba.Many people feel confused,for Alibaba is widely known as "not interested in pure financial investments" when it comes to thinking about its relationship with fast growing startups in China.If that is true,then we could come to a conclusion that Tencent now acts as xiaohongshu's "pure financial investor",and Alibaba is thus the strategic investor.</p></p>
