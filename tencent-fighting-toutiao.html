<p>On June 2,Toutiao said that Tencent has used its monopoly position to engage in unfair competition on a number of occasions for various reasons.In response to the rival's action that Q-zone and Tencent Security Housekeeper block Toutiao's bpage links,Toutiao has decided to put up a fight and sued Tencent.</p>
<p>Q-zone is a social platform owned by Tencent and its main users are Chinese young teenagers.It can be recognized as China's Facebook.Q-zone and Toutiao's video app Douyin have a shared user base ,which is the biggest reason that Tencent must keep an eye on Toutiao.Douyin has grown insanely fast this year,especially after the Spring Festival of 2018 and now has more than 100 million users,who generates over 1 billion videos per day.</p>
<p>It seems that Tencent should take action to guard its territory.And they did.Tencent turns to Weshi,again.</p>
<p>In fact,Tencent is one of the earliest companies in China that launched short video products.It shipped a short video app named Weshi back in 2013.However,the app did not meet the expectations of Tencent's managers,desipte that they had invested a lot of resource.In 2015,after around 2 years after the app was born,Weshi was marginalised by Tencent.Finally,it was officially closed on April 10 2017.</p>
<p>In May 2017,when everyone in Tencent thought that Weshi was gone forever,a brand new version of Weshi appeared in the App Store.It was a new product rather than an old one.According to a Tencent employer,Tencent did not figure out how to rejoin the short video battle field in the beginning until the rise of Douyin in 2017.The upstart made people in Tencent feel nervous.Weshi was rearranged to Tencent's SNG(social networking group) division and was handled by the Q-zone team.Since then,the speed the Weshi's iteration was obviously accelerating.</p>
<p>Weshi is back.Tencent is back.Today,the importance of the short video app is beyond doubt.Not only Tencent,Chinese search engine giant Baidu and online shopping company Alibaba also released short video product this year.The competition is becoming more and more firece.It is disturbing for the tech giants to think that the young generations they have been dreaming for are addicted to Douyin.</p></p></div>
