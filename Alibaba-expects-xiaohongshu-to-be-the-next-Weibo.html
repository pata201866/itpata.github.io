<p>Xiaohongshu released the news that it has completed its 300 million 
dollars in the Series D round of funding.The investors including <a href="./tag-alibaba.html">Alibaba</a> ,Tencent and other ventures.</p>
<p>Note that xiaohongshu brought in 100 million dollars fund-raising 2 years ago.It was led by Tencent,Alibaba's biggest competitor in China.This time,the fund was led by Alibaba.Many people feel confused,for Alibaba is widely known as "not interested in pure financial investments" when it comes to thinking about its relationship with fast growing startups in China.If that is true,then we could come to a conclusion that Tencent now acts as xiaohongshu's "pure financial investor",and Alibaba is thus the strategic investor.</p>
<p>In this year,xiaohongshu has been gaining increasing traffic when they made a decision to sponsor programs and shows chased by China's young women.On April 12 2018,users who downloaded the xiaohongshu app reached its peak,when a reality television show , distributed via Chinese social media Tencent's video site and app, was on air.The reality tv show went viral,and audience rushed to the App store as xiaohongshu got mentioned by the show host and commercials a lot during 2 hours.</p>
<p>Chinese stars and actresses are also essential to attract young girls to come in.fan bingbing,a household name in China,teaches girls how to make up.Another actress,lin yun posted her daily thoughts on xiaohongshu,including the dress for a party,delicious food and exercise notes.</p>
<p>Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013.The company has grown into the world's biggest social commerce platform by focusing on UGC (user-generated content).The fast growing community is largely driven by word of mouth and Prime Minister Li Keqiang has praised xiaohongshu as "one of the fastest growing Internet startups".By October 2017,it had attracted more than 70 million users to its platform.The company showed great potential to transform its popularity among Chinese young women to cash when it sold goods valued over 100 million yuan within 2 hours on its anniversary day in 2017.Its ranking in shopping category of the App Store even surpassed Alibaba and JD.com.</p>
<p>Last November, xiaohongshu said it reached its break-even point. Xiaohongshu did not plan to make money from content,according to Qu Fang,the founder of the company.</p>
<p>These days,social commerce has been playing a substantially important role in China's online shopping market.Weibo,China's twitter,has recognized and experienced the great economic benefits after Alibaba becomes its second biggest investor.The cooperation between two companies is a win-win.Weibo's share price began to soar since Weibo started to offer Alibaba's taobao traffic and there is no need to mention that Alibaba's success.</p>
<p>So,will xiaohongshu become the next Weibo?Just wait and see.</p></p></div>
